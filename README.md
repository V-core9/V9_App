# V9_App

1. Created base setup for the project with folders for API, MySQL & NGINX.  
2. Added base docker-compose file and a RUN shell script to start a project.  
3. Copied over environment files from other project I was working on.
4. Generated API using Express Generator with pug engine so it can handle a nice error page.
5. Added swagger with JSDocs to apis "/docs" route.  
6. Edited swagger comments to include tags for the documentation endpoints grouping.
7. Minor edits to swagger spec settings/options.
